<p>Welcome to the FE_Final_Project wiki!</p>

<p>Collaborators: Julian Morris, Charlie Mouton (<a href="https://github.com/CharlieMouton" class="user-mention">@CharlieMouton</a>), Jacob Riedel, and David Zhu (<a href="https://github.com/hzhugit" class="user-mention">@hzhugit</a>).</p>

<p>The goal of this project is to create a turn-based strategy battle game similar to Fire Emblem and Final Fantasy Tactics. This project is the final assignment for Software Design, a programming course offered at Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering taught by Paul Ruvolo (<a href="https://github.com/pruvolo" class="user-mention">@pruvolo</a>).</p>

<a name="proposal" class="anchor" href="#proposal"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Proposal</h3>

<p>Our team, consisting of Julian Morris, Charlie Mouton, Jacob Riedel, and David Zhu, aim to create a turn-based strategy game akin to Fire Emblem and Final Fantasy Tactics. Our game will utilize a grid battlefield, and using basic stats such as attack, defense, crit chance, and dodge chance, characters will battle each other with the sole purpose of killing all opponents. Players will have control of each member of their team, and with the use of their environment and tactical maneuvering, they will attempt to kill all opponents. We will have a few different classes of units, including warrior, knight, and archer, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Players will have to protect their weaker characters while dishing enough damage on their turn.</p>

<p>If things don't go as planned, our group will at least produce a top-down, two-player, gridded, simple battle scenario. Characters will have slightly randomized stats, and we will have at least three classes. The battlefield will have two or three terrain advantages, but nothing that fully blocks off sections of the field or interferes with combat interactions. We may download several sprites to represent the characters, but there won't be a visual theme to the game.</p>

<p>If things do go according to plan, however, we will have a 3d view of the field with lots of interactive terrain that may even swing the tides of battle. We will have more in-depth classes, with special abilities for each. The visuals of the game will be cohesive and add to the game, instead of detract from it. We may also add in objectives to the maps, or alternate ways to win. We would have multiple scenarios and maps, and possibly even have a "vs AI" option when two people aren't available to play. We may also add a store with items, so that we can have weapon interactions as well as potions and the like. One of the great things about this project is we have a lot of places we can go if we have time to improve at the end.</p>

<p>Our first step will be to design a basic character object, that has attributes for its battle stats (DMG,DEF,CRT,DGE). We then will create a field layout where we can have two characters interact with each other. From here, we will start going more in depth on properties of the field and classes for the characters and then start making everything look good.</p>

<p>For our group, no one has too much experience for the visual side of things, so I think that is the area where we will struggle the most. We will have to be careful that we don't get so caught up in enhancing all other aspects of the game that the visual side will get left behind. We will be looking for ways to simplify the VIEW side of pygame while also maintaining a visually appealing game.</p>

<p>We are all excited to see what the product of this project will be, especially looking forward to the ways that we will shape this game into our own as we start to individualize from the Fire Emblem and Final Fantasy base that we will start with.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>P.S. We are not collaborating with any other groups. We have no need for an angel advisor. We are not working across fields or with another course. Thanks again!</p>
